# MyK8s

My local lab set up as Infrastruce As Code.  The local Kubernetes cluster is a mix of Raspberry Pis and AMD64 architectures.  Deployments include
- Kubernetes
- MetalLB
- PiHole
- Jenkins
- Terraform
- Consul
- Vault

Runs are split into three sections:  prerequisites, the hashistack, and services needed for application development.
